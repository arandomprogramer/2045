# 1945 Arcade game


## Original Game
 The original  game was developed by the Japanese company Capcom in 1984 and it was originally called 1942. In 1986, this arcade game was in the top five highest grossing games in both the U.S. and Japan. Sequels to this game include 1945, which this game is based off of. Someone named Haroon Khalid cloned this game to python, and the base of our game was made out of it. The link to the original game: https://github.com/sodacrunch/1945. Some of the graphics were copied from the original Capcom game, and remodled by Ari Feldman.

## My Project Fixed and Improved the Game
* Fixed broken code 
    * bombs didn't work
    * could not respawn properly
    * high score didn't work
    * along with many other features.
* Added features 
    * introduced guided missiles
    * intruduced newer planes such as the F-35 and the MIG-21
    * introduced a game over screen
    * introduced an updated menu screen
    * introduced increasing difficulty

## Pygame
The game uses the python library Pygame, which allows for Python to control the computer's underlying multimedia hardware, such as sound, video, keyboard, and mouse. I used modern programming techniques such as object oriented programming, conditional statements, and loops.
